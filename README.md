# EEC-172-Final-Project
## Final Project for EEC 172
### Implementing Rolling Ball Maze Game using CC3200 with OLED and Accelerometer
For detailed report and instructions, refer to 
#### Introduction
EEC 172 makes use of the CC3200 LaunchPad to
demonstrate and experiment with the concept of embedded
systems. With this CC3200, simple games can be implemented
with the use of the built in accelerometer and OLED, as well
as other components if desired. The WiFi module on the
CC3200 allows the CC3200 to communicate with the AWS
IoT service to fetch and store data.

For the EEC 172 final project, the CC3200 is to be
implemented in some way in which it uses two-way
communication with AWS.
